      <p>
        There is always a reason why certain things were done the way they were.
        Technology moves fast and things change very quickly. There is legacy
        code that hangs around for a long time — especially in large
        organisations. You can voice your opinion in a diplomatic way, but don’t
        be arrogant about it or make fun of those who are still using old
        technologies. Unless, of course, you are willing to rewrite and refactor
        that legacy code base in a week. Then you can talk.

      <h2>
        <strong
          >“Code reviews are a waste of time. Everyone should just write good
          code.”</strong
        >
      </h2>

      <p>
        Firstly, code reviews are a good thing. If you have never had a
        commercial experience with code reviews before because you have just
        graduated or your previous companies didn’t use it, it is OK to say so.
        But as a technical person and a developer, you are expected to at least
        understand why they exist. Code reviews are not there just to detect
        code smells. They are also for knowledge sharing and ensuring that
        coding standards and requirements are met.

        <strong
          >“I would rather write new features from scratch than fix other
          people’s bugs.”</strong
        >
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have heard this statement way too many times. These candidates are
        often contractors who chase out greenfield projects, and their contracts
        finish when those projects go live. I understand many developers want to
        work with a blank canvas and build things from scratch using the latest
        and greatest technology, but that does not mean they do a better job or
        are a better developer. You can learn a lot from fixing bugs (whether
        they are your own or of other developers’) as well as optimising and
        scaling existing systems.
